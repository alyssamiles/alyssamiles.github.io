            My name is Alyssa Miles, known through my art as <a class="fancy-link" href="/portfolio">[A2]</a>. I am a multi-disciplinary artist focused mainly on Music & Programming, with experience in Animation, traditional / digital Art, and Voice Work.

           Art & my projects are what matter most to me, acting as an outlet for the emotions & feelings. My main goal is to create tangible work that any person could appreciate, specific people will take to heart, and those who deeply appreciate it can have a special connection (like I do with much of the art I like).
        </p>

            7 years ago (at age 13) I began creating music in my room. I didn't have much of an interest in music before being put in piano lessons 3 years prior, but the works of others, especially on the internet, gave me a fond appreciation for independent & individual artists trying to get their message out to anyone who may happen to stumble across it. That sense of discovery, wonder, and appreciation for unknown talent is what I love so much about art & the internet, and is why I focus on it so much in my life.

        <p>
            7 years later, I am now an independent releasing artist of my own. Newfound passions in Programming, Animation, Art, and more have embellished my life to a degree I can't begin to explain. The ability to share this feeling with anybody in the world is a main driving force in my creative output, and I really believe that it reflects in my work. Influence from all kinds of genre, style, and walk of life flower & enhance art, creating a wonderful mixture & evolution of so many ideas from all kinds of people.
