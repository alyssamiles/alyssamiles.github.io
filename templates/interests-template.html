        <p>As a multi-disciplined artist I have a lot of interests in various areas, including (generally) music, programming, art, animation, and voice work.</p>
        <p>Interest in game development & large-scale projects have me making content for my youtube channel with over 7,000 subscribers. Since I started making music over 7 years ago I have built an audience & passion for creating content online.</p>
        <p>Through my general interests there are more specific focuses I have in each area, UI/UX & Systems design in programming, Sound Design & Experimental Music, and rig-based animation.</p>
        <p>General interests of mine have changed a bit over the last few years, and as of late I have become fond of climbing, niche music history & general topic research, and fashion / design.</p>
